Client registration for Vila Facil.

In this case, I need to develop everything from registration and login for Vila Facil's employees to the login for the Vila Facil manager.

- AFD Import
  This feature is a tool for MarQ's clients' managers to import AFD (Arquivo Fiscal Digital), which is a digital fiscal file used for tax purposes and electronic bookkeeping of tax documents in Brazil. With this feature, the client can upload time tracking data for multiple employees simultaneously.

- Feature Customization of layout for payroll
  
  This feature allows the client to create a layout for each payroll pattern they have. It enables the creation of a conversion table with the tags in MarQ that need to be included in the payroll. This facilitates the payroll creation process and allows for the generation of a standardized file to be sent to the accountant.
